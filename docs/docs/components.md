# Components

vue-pdf implements custom Component types that allow you to structure your PDF document.

## Document

This component represents the PDF document itself. It _must_ be the root of your tree element structure, and under no circumstances should it be used as child of another vue-pdf component. In addition, it should only have children of type `<Page />`.

[API Reference for Document](../api-reference#document)

## Page

Represents single page inside the PDF documents, or a subset of them if using the wrapping feature. A `<Document />` can contain as many pages as you want, but ensures not rendering a page inside any component besides Document.
