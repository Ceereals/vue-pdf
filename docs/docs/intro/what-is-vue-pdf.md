# What is Vue PDF?

Vue PDF is a library for creating and rendering PDF documents using Vue components. It leverages the powerful layout engine and PDF rendering capabilities from [@react-pdf](https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf) while replacing the React component model with Vue's reactivity and rendering system. This makes it easy to integrate PDF generation into your Vue applications or in a server-side application.

## How It Works

- **Robust Rendering:** By relying on [@react-pdf](https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf) for its core layout and rendering engine, Vue PDF ensures high-quality PDF outputs.
- **Vue-Powered Components:** Instead of React, Vue PDF uses Vue's reactivity and rendering system, making it a natural fit for Vue-based projects.
- **Browser and Node.js Support:** Vue PDF can be used in both browser and Node.js environments, allowing you to generate PDFs on the client or server side.

## Use Cases

- **Dynamic Document Generation:** Create PDFs on the fly using Vue's reactive data binding.
- **Reporting and Invoicing:** Generate structured reports, invoices, and other business documents programmatically.
- **Custom Layouts:** Build complex, custom document layouts by composing simple Vue components.

> [!WARNING]
> Vue PDF is still in the early stages of development. While it is already usable for many use cases, you may encounter bugs or missing features. If you find any issues, please report them on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ceereals/vue-pdf/issues/new).

## Developer Experience

Vue PDF is built with the developer in mind:

- **Seamless Vue Integration:** Enjoy features like hot module reloading, Vue Devtools support, and seamless component composition.
- **Easy to Learn and Extend:** Work with familiar Vue paradigms to build and customize PDF documents without a steep learning curve.
- **Comprehensive Testing Support:** Ensure the reliability of your PDF generation logic with integrated unit test support.

> [!WARNING]
> Vue devtools support is not yet available. We are working on adding this feature in a future release.

Whether you need to generate dynamic reports or embed PDF creation into your Vue application, Vue PDF delivers a developer-friendly solution with the flexibility and power of Vue.
